Since only task management functionality is requested, a single collection `tasks` is used, with each task document containing all necessary information. No subcollections are used in this simplified design. Access is open to all authenticated users, suitable for a basic task tracking app. For enhanced security in a real-world application, access control lists and more complex role-based authorization would be added. Tasks are placed under a single collection without any parent-child relationship."
