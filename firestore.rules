/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for TaskFlow project.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows authenticated users to read all tasks.
 * It does NOT enforce any specific data shapes for tasks, allowing for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All tasks are stored in a top-level `/tasks/{taskId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Authenticated users can read all tasks (public read).
 * - No user-specific data segregation.
 * - Tasks documents must be created, updated, and deleted only by authenticated users.

     * @description Controls access to individual task documents. Allows any authenticated user to read tasks. All authenticated users can create, update, and delete tasks.
     * @path /tasks/{taskId}
     * @allow (get, list) - Any authenticated user can read any task.
     *   Example: User with any auth can read /tasks/some_task_id.
     * @allow (create) - Any authenticated user can create a new task.
     *   Example: User with auth 'uid123' can create a new task document.
     * @allow (update) - Any authenticated user can update an existing task.
     *   Example: User with auth 'uid123' can update /tasks/some_task_id.
     * @allow (delete) - Any authenticated user can delete an existing task.
     *   Example: User with auth 'uid123' can delete /tasks/some_task_id.
     * @deny (create, update, delete) - Unauthenticated users cannot create, update or delete tasks.
     *   Example: An unauthenticated user cannot perform any write operation.
     * @principle Allows public read access, while any authenticated user can write any data.
