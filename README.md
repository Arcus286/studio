## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment using [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting).

To deploy your application and make it available as a public website, you will need to:

1.  **Connect to a Firebase Project:** Link your local codebase to a Firebase project in the cloud.
2.  **Deploy:** Run the deployment command from your terminal.

Once deployed, Firebase will provide you with a public URL where your website will be live.
